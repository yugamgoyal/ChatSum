# ChatSum

**Inspiration**

In a rapidly evolving digital world, multiple communication platforms are becoming the norm rather than the exception. The necessity to streamline these channels for efficient management of communication, especially in the enterprise context, inspired us to create ChatSum.

**What it does**

ChatSum integrates various enterprise communication tools like Slack, Zoom, Telegram, and Whatsapp into a singular hub. It provides a summarized view of unread updates, allowing users to stay connected with their team and prioritize their response based on importance.

**How we built it**

Leveraging the APIs of various communication platforms, we developed a system that collects, organizes, and summarizes the unread messages. The backend is designed to handle multiple data streams simultaneously, ensuring real-time updates. On the frontend, we created an intuitive user interface for easy navigation and understanding.

**Challenges we ran into**

Balancing real-time data collection from various platforms with performance was a significant challenge. We also faced issues ensuring compatibility between different platforms, as each has its own unique set of functionalities and structures.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**

We're proud of building a tool that brings significant convenience to users managing multiple communication platforms. Our system's ability to accurately summarize updates and facilitate efficient communication is a significant achievement.

**What we learned**

Through the development of ChatSum, we learned about integrating various APIs, handling real-time data streams, and creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface. We also learned how to prioritize information for summary, which was crucial for the functionality of our platform.

**What's next for ChatSum**

In the future, we aim to expand ChatSum to personal messaging platforms. We also plan to incorporate more tools and companies to broaden our reach. Additionally, we envision transforming ChatSum into a notes hub where documents can be scanned and summarized. Customization options are also on the roadmap to allow users to create their own workspace and personalize notifications and summary formats.

**Why are we safe?**
